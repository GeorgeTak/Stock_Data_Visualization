# Stock_Data_Visualization
Description
This project is a Python application for analyzing and predicting stock prices. It uses historical stock data to perform various analyses and predictions. The functionalities include:

- Plotting historical stock prices.
- Printing well-known stock ticker symbols.
- Calculating and displaying stock statistics such as minimum, maximum, and average closing prices.
- Performing linear regression to predict future stock prices.
- Using Random Forest regression for predicting future stock prices.
The application leverages the yfinance library to fetch stock data, pandas for data manipulation, matplotlib for plotting, and scikit-learn for machine learning models.

Features
- Plot Stock Data: Visualizes historical stock closing prices.
- Print Ticker Symbols: Displays a list of well-known stock ticker symbols.
- Calculate Stock Statistics: Computes and displays the minimum, maximum, and average closing prices for a given stock.
- Perform Linear Regression: Applies linear regression to predict future stock prices and visualizes both historical and future predictions.
- Perform Random Forest Regression: Applies Random Forest regression to predict future stock prices and visualizes future predictions.

Requirements
- Python 3.x
- yfinance
- pandas
- matplotlib
